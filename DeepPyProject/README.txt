Motivation:
I like to organize projects into neat files and folders. It's always
so tempting to test or execute a piece by cd'ing into a subfolder
and then calling python there. But the deep pieces can't easily see
the parts at higher levels, and often importing from .. doesn't seem
to work. Then I learned it works better to add a simple starting point
at the top level. I call it 'start_here.py' and this demo shows how it
works and how your import statements can be pretty simple...

DeepPyProject has several nested folders (layers) of simple code.
Calls are made to both higher and lower layers.
We show how to start execution at a deep layer.
Call python on 'start_here.py' at the top layer.
