For Windows Users
=================
1. Go into the Windows/ folder.
2. Look at the Contents and GettingStarted docs there.
3. There is nothing to build.
4. Go into the language subfolder of your choice and follow the README or the doc for building a demo Visual Studio project.

For All Users
=============
I've recently added scripts demoing how to drive the wavePlayer:
+ Scripts are: {wp_XXX}.
+ You'll have to edit the SpikeGLX network addr, as with the DemoRemoteAPI script.
+ At the SDK top level, JWAVE is an example wave you can try.

There are additional docs for all users in General Docs/.
